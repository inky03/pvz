heavily unfinished... basically my first actual [l√∂ve](http://love2d.org) project so im just testing the waters... by recreating the entirety of pvz i guess!

i hope this is a Nice Learning Expereince


## how to work

this project doesnt condone piracy!<br>
this repository does NOT contain the game assets, but are required for it to function ; as such you will need the files from your copy of the original game.

- extract main.pak from your Plants vs. Zombies copy
- make a main folder in resources/ and dump the content folders (reanim, compiled, etc) inside

you might now test the project as any other love2d project. if everything is done correctly, it should work (somewhat!)
