heavily unfinished... basically my first actual [l√∂ve](http://love2d.org) project so im just testing the waters... by recreating the entirety of pvz i guess!

i hope this is a Nice Learning Expereince


## how to work

- extract main.pak from your Plants vs Zombies copy
- make a main folder in resources/ and dump the content folders (reanim, compiled, etc) inside
- test the project as any other love2d project.

if everything is done correctly, it should work (somewhat!)


## thanks

- PopCap Games cause they, like, made the whole game, yk...

- [gamera](https://github.com/kikito/gamera) (camera library)
- [30log](https://github.com/Yonaba/30log) (oop library)

## todo

- finish the entire freaking game
- implement Particles (needs research)
- improve Reanimations (attaching particles ~~and more reanimations~~ (that sorta works now))
